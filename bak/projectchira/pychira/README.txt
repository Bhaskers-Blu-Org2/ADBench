Best way to get running with python:

Get python 2.7 64 bit from www.python.org

Install the binary packages from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
Or the binaries under handpose\dependencies\python 
(just click to install - solution will find these dependencies)

We also recommend installing Python Tools for Visual Studio Tools 
https://pytools.codeplex.com/

You want at least:

numpy
vtk (VTK?5.10.1.win?amd64?py2.7.exe)
matplotlib

Perhaps a bit more.

  This Handbook describes ADiMat 0.6.0.

  1.  Installation on Windows


  1. Unpack the download archive. A directory called
     adimat-0.6.0-4971-mingw32-i686 is created. This is the ADiMat home
     directory. Before you proceed with the following steps, you are
     free to rename or move this directory as you like, for example to
     c:/adimat.


  2. Within Matlab (or Octave), navigate to the directory where you
     installed ADiMat, which contains this file (Install.txt). Execute
     the following command:


       ADiMat_startup



  This adds several directories of ADiMat to the path, and also sets the
  environment variable $ADIMAT_HOME. You probably wish to make this
  change permanent, to do this, execute ADiMat_startup from your
  startup.m (Matlab) or ~/.octaverc (Octave). For example add this line:



       run('c:/adimat/ADiMat_startup');



  The following two steps are optional, if you want to also use ADiMat
  from the command line:


  1. Create an environment variable, ADIMAT_HOME, that contains the path
     to the ADiMat home directory. In the control panel, add the
     environment variable ADIMAT_HOME, for example with the value
     c:/adimat.


  2. Also, you should also set your PATH variable to include
     %ADIMAT_HOME%\bin.


  For any questions feel free to contact us via the ADiMat Users mailing
  list <mailto:adimat-users@lists.sc.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>.

  In order to build and install ADiMat from the sources, read the file
  BUILD in the base directory of the ADiMat source distribution.
